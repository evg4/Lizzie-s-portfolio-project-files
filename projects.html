                employs all skills learned so far: semantic HTML to create

                the page; flexbox with images that resize/wrap as needed; a

                <strong>Details:</strong> I wanted to practise making images
                which had semi-transparent captions that appeared when the mouse
                hovered over them. To do so, I used divs and :hover rulesets.

                <strong>Details:</strong> The new skill being practised here is
                the use of @media rulesets to ensure responsive design. Note the

                elements. It involves basic validation for some fields. Answers
                are not actually sent anywhere, though I have set up a "thank
                you" page which displays after the form has been submitted.<br /><br />Click

                <strong>Details:</strong> This started as a project to be run in
                Node.js that I completed as part of the Codecademy Front-End
                Engineer path. The purpose was to practise using classes. When
                the programme is run, a field is randomly generated and user
                must navigate through the field to find their hat ^. I then
                wanted to see if I could adapt it for use in the browser, so I
                made a webpage using HTML and CSS then copied the JavaScript
                code and made amendments as needed.<br /><br />Click

                importing and exporting modules in the Node runtime environment.
                The file quiz-questions.js has an array of questions and an
                array of corresponding answers. The three quizzes all use the
                same questions, but work in a slightly different way.

                setTimer, and the background changes to a random colour at the
                same time. I created it using create-react-app.

                <strong>Details:</strong> The aim of this project was to combine
                all skills learned so far in one React app. Jammming connects to
                the Spotify API to allow users to search for songs, add them to
                a playlist then save to their own Spotify account. In part 2 we
                were encouraged to personalise the project with new features. I
                added the ability to play a sample of the song (where possible)
                as well as "previous" and "next" buttons so the user can see
                more results.

                <br /><br />
                Due to limitations with the API, I cannot deploy this, but the
                video above shows the basic functionality, including the alerts
                that appear if buttons are clicked at the wrong time.
