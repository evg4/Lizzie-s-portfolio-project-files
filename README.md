## Title

## Description 
This portfolio was built as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The primary purpose is to document the projects I have worked on. The "Projects" page has links to each project I have carried out so far, with the early ones all being built with the aim of practising a specific skill. The "Courses" page has details of the courses I have taken/am taking as I learn how to code. There is also an "About" page (the homepage) and "Contact" page, with links to my socials. This portfolio has been optimised for different screen sizes, with layout changing accordingly. 
Now that I have learnt more, I would like to rebuild this using React as I think it would be more efficient. For example, in the current implementation, every time I add a new button and project to the "Projects" page, I manually copy and paste code and make relevant changes. In React, I could do this by adding the data in an array, and mapping over the array to render duplicate elements.
I would also like to change the current "Projects" page to contain only complete projects. At the moment, there are some things in there which are just skills-practising rather than a complete app/website. I would like to move these things onto a "Blog" page, so I can still log my learnings, but keep full-size projects separate.
