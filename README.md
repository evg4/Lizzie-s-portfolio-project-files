Portfolio
## Description
This website was built as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path. The "Projects" page has links to each project I have carried out so far, with the early ones all being built with the aim of practising a specific skill. The "Courses" page has details of the courses I have taken/am taking as I learn how to code. This portfolio has been optimised for different screen sizes, with layout changing accordingly. As my skills develop, I intend to revisit certain sections and improve upon code wherever possible.
The site uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.
## How to use
This has been put together to be viewed as a webpage accessible at [https://evg4.github.io/](https://evg4.github.io/Portfolio/index.html). All individual files can be viewed locally in a browser.
## Technologies
The portfolio website itself is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
