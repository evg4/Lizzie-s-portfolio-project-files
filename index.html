          <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Lizzie and I’ve recently discovered my passion for
            coding. <br /><br />I have a degree in German and Spanish Linguistic
            Studies and have since learnt Italian, too. I’ve lived in Cartagena,
            Spain, and Bremen, Germany, and am now based back in my hometown in
            West Yorkshire. <br /><br />I’m currently a self-employed translator
            and I'm teaching myself to code alongside my work. <br /><br />Apart
            from that, I’m a keen salsa and bachata dancer, bookworm (when I get
            time to read!) and a volunteer for Girlguiding. <br /><br />Keep
            reading for more details on my
            <a href="#bottom">background in coding</a>, or visit my
            <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page to see the things I’ve
            been working on.

                I think there is a common belief that someone is good at either
                maths or English, and that they only like one or the other. That
                was never true for me as I loved both! But it was always the
                grammar that I enjoyed most in English because it appealed to my
                analytical mind and my love of logic (i.e., the reasons I loved
                maths). I ended up doing a degree in German and Spanish
                Linguistic Studies, finding that, for me, linguistics was the
                perfect way to combine my love of logic and languages. After I
                graduated, I also learnt Italian, and followed a career in the
                languages industry for a few years.
                <br /><br />When I reached a point where I was no longer
                enjoying my position, I started to have a think about what else
                I could do, and I recalled how much I had enjoyed linguistics,
                particularly syntax. After talking to friends who had recently
                moved into the tech industry with no background in computers, I
                googled “coding”. The more I read, the more it seemed like it
                would be something I would enjoy. After all, I had already
                learnt three foreign languages; surely learning a programming
                language would be no different? If anything, I reasoned, it
                would be easier, because there probably wouldn’t be exceptions
                to grammar rules like there are in spoken languages!
                <br />

                So I decided to dip my toe in the world of coding and see what I
                thought. I started with Python, because I read that it was good
                for analytical minds. It was a free course and I was doing it
                very sporadically whenever I had the time. However, I was
                enjoying it, so I decided to pay for a short course, knowing I’d
                be encouraged to do it more regularly if I’d invested money. I
                did some more reading, and many sources recommended HTML and CSS
                as a good place to start, so I enrolled on the SheCodes Basics
                course. It confirmed to me that I definitely wanted to pursue
                this further, but I wasn’t in a position where I could drop
                everything and pay for an expensive, full-time course. So
                instead, I signed up for a year’s membership on Codecademy so I
                could access a wide range of learning materials and study at my
                own pace. At the moment, I’m working my way through the
                Front-End Engineer path. My ultimate goal is to get a career as
                a developer of some sort.
                <br /><br />On the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page of
                this website, I am documenting all the web pages I have created
                during my learning journey. Feel free to take a look!
