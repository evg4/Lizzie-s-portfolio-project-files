          <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Lizzie, a linguist-turned-coder based in West Yorkshire.
            <br /><br />I set up this website in mid-2023 to document my
            progress as I learnt to code and started job hunting. <br /><br />
            In February 2024 I secured my first role in tech as a Pega
            Apprentice and have been enjoying learning the low-code Pega
            platform and settling into my new role.
            <br /><br />I’m also a keen salsa and bachata dancer, language
            lover, and member of Girlguiding. <br /><br />Keep reading for more
            details on my <a href="#bottom">background in coding</a>, or visit
            my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page to see the things I’ve
            been working on.

              <p>
                I think there is a common belief that someone is good at either
                maths or English, and that they only like one or the other. That
                was never true for me; I loved both and studied both to A-level.
                It was always the grammar that I enjoyed most in English because
                it appealed to my analytical mind and my love of logic (i.e.,
                the reasons I loved maths), so I ended up doing a degree in
                German and Spanish Linguistic Studies, finding that linguistics
                was the perfect way to combine my love of logic and languages.
                After I graduated, I learnt Italian and then started my career
                in the languages industry, working as a teaching assistant in
                Spain and Germany and then setting up my own business as a
                freelance translator.
                <br /><br />I first became curious about coding when a friend of
                mine, who also did a linguistics degree, told me she was now
                working in cyber security. She told me about her role and I was
                surprised that something so "techy" could link so well to
                linguistics. The more I found out, the more it seemed like it
                would be something I would enjoy. After all, I had already
                learnt three foreign languages; surely learning a programming
                language would be no different? If anything, I reasoned, it
                would be easier, because there probably wouldn’t be exceptions
                to grammar rules like there are in spoken languages!
                <br />

                So I decided to dip my toe in the world of coding and see what I
                thought. I started with Python, because I read that it was good
                for analytical minds. It was a free course and I was doing it
                very sporadically whenever I had the time. I really enjoyed it,
                though, so I decided to pay for a short course, knowing I’d be
                encouraged to do it more regularly if I’d invested money. I did
                some more reading, and many sources recommended HTML and CSS as
                a good place to start, so I enrolled on the SheCodes Basics
                course. I created a <a href="https://evg4.github.io/Salsa-dancing/">simple webpage</a> and was addicted, so I signed
                up for a year’s membership on Codecademy so I could access a
                wide range of materials and learn at my own pace. Within the
                next year, I completed the Front-End course, met a great
                community of women in tech and secured my first junior developer
                role. I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me!
                <br /><br />On the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page of
                this website, I am documenting everything I've created during my
                learning journey. Feel free to take a look! <br /><br />
