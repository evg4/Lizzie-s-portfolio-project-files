          <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Lizzie and I’ve recently discovered a passion for coding.
            <br /><br />I have a degree in German and Spanish Linguistic Studies
            and have since learnt Italian, too. I’ve lived in Cartagena, Spain,
            and Bremen, Germany, and am now based back in my hometown in West
            Yorkshire. <br /><br />I’m currently a self-employed translator and
            I'm teaching myself to code alongside my work. <br /><br />Apart
            from that, I’m a keen salsa and bachata dancer, bookworm (when I get
            time to read!) and a volunteer for Girlguiding. <br /><br />Keep
            reading for more details on my
            <a href="#bottom">background in coding</a>, or visit my
            <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page to see the things I’ve
            been working on.

                I think there is a common belief that someone is good at either
                maths or English, and that they only like one or the other. That
                was never true for me as I loved both! But it was always the
                grammar that I enjoyed most in English because it appealed to my
                analytical mind and my love of logic (i.e., the reasons I loved
                maths). I ended up doing a degree in German and Spanish
                Linguistic Studies, finding that, for me, linguistics was the
                perfect way to combine my love of logic and languages. After I
                graduated, I also learnt Italian, and since then have been
                working in the languages industry, most recently as a
                translator.
                <br /><br />I first became curious about coding when a friend of
                mine, who also did a linguistics degree, told me she was now
                working in cyber security. She told me about her role and I was
                surprised that something so "techy" could link so well to
                linguistics. The more I read, the more it seemed like it would
                be something I would enjoy. After all, I had already learnt
                three foreign languages; surely learning a programming language
                would be no different? If anything, I reasoned, it would be
                easier, because there probably wouldn’t be exceptions to grammar
                rules like there are in spoken languages!
                <br />

                So I decided to dip my toe in the world of coding and see what I
                thought. I started with Python, because I read that it was good
                for analytical minds. It was a free course and I was doing it
                very sporadically whenever I had the time. I really enjoyed it,
                though, so I decided to pay for a short course, knowing I’d be
                encouraged to do it more regularly if I’d invested money. I did
                some more reading, and many sources recommended HTML and CSS as
                a good place to start, so I enrolled on the SheCodes Basics
                course. I created a simple webpage and was addicted, so I signed
                up for a year’s membership on Codecademy so I could access a
                wide range of materials and learn at my own pace. At the moment,
                I’m working my way through the Front-End Engineer path. Once I
                learn more, I'd love to create a website for my translation
                business!
                <br /><br />On the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page of
                this website, I am documenting everything I've created during my
                learning journey. Feel free to take a look! <br /><br />
